# Code-Workshop-2023
At the University of Oklahoma, graduate students (people working on Masterâ€™s of Science or Doctorate of Philosophy degrees) and faculty have teamed up to host a week-long workshop that covers everything from the basics of coding to more advanced techniques to answer more complicated questions in STEM fields.

This repository contains the materials and code used in the two-day Code Workshop that I had the privilege to teach at the University of Oklahoma. The workshop was designed to provide participants with an introductory understanding of Python programming.

The workshop was designed to be interactive, enabling participants to gain hands-on experience with Python programming. The materials covered not only the basic syntax of Python but also provided step-by-step instructions, from installation to advanced topics, empowering students to apply Python in practical scenarios.
